## Brodokk personal notes

> On things that need to be done before thinking doing any release

- [x] Fully connect the Discord auth with fastapi-users
- [x] Clean code the merge between discord and fastapi-users and commit
- [ ] Hide all private events unless
  - [x] They are connected
  - [x] The user have the role administrator
  - [x] The user have access to a community, in this case only the private event of this community are showed
- [x] Verify the support of the JSON signal
- [x] Seems like the Private communities and/or private events are not showed as tracked on the web page
- [x] Put back the support of the rate-limit stuff
- [x] The stream signal collector seems to not work
- [x] Redo the doc on a website instead with mkdocs
- [x] For better testing add a way for the admistrator to view the events as
  - JUST think about a simple and nice way to do that in the code, i know i can just uncheck the option to go from super admin to simple user but this mean that i also to touch stuff in the database to remove some community to my user
  - Maybe add a bit of documentation on the subject? General documentation is needed anyway...
  - [x] A connected user and part of somes communities but not other
  - [x] A connected user that is part of no communities
  - [x] A non connected user
- [x] Make possible to start all the clients together (web and http api) on default port
  - [x] add an option to change host and port
  - [x] Update the documentation in consequence in "Developer Guide" > "Usage"
- [x] Check the behavior for the API: text and json
  - [x] Also update the documentation "Client Integration" at the same time
- [x] **FIX VERY BAD BUG** Look into why for whatever reason the cookies are not saved at all anymore
- [x] Fix the fact that the web interface and the API return only the event for Resonite and nothing else
  - [x] Save the location in tags for now, either vrchat or resonite
  - [x] Only show the events for resonite in the webinterface
  - [x] Only show the events for resonite in the API
- [x] Remove useless tags from the web client as: "public", "resonite"
- [x] Go a check of all the TODO and FIXME
- [x] Look into why the BDD have very high ids for community end events
- [ ] Set up the new stack for production (and preproduction) with docker container and such
  - [x] Update the documentation in "Developer Guide" > "Server Installation"
  - [x] Switch to alembic for the migrations
  - [x] Finish to work on the docker file
    - [x] Test the client and manager in a container
    - [x] Finish to setup the healthcheck system instead of using the depends_on feature
  - [x] Use traefik to root everything
    - [x] Keep the /v1
    - [x] Prepare for the v2 on /api/v2 instead, if possible. See if something can be done in traefik for that and dont forget to update the doc
    - [x] Test from another computer (like that i can test that the full development process in resonite works for me - not really but that should be ok like that)
  - Keep in mind to ease the developement process so we should still be able to use sqlite locally while use a postgresql instance while on the production stack
- [x] Setup the deployment in preproduction (dev.resonite-communities.com)
- [x] Add monitoring into the api part too, copy middleware and such
- [x] Fix api v1 text for resonite who doesnt work well
- [x] Dont show events who are canceled in the API and the Web client
- [x] The web client show the title instead of the description
- [x] Do not show any of the private community on the front page
- [x] Setup the deployment for the documentation (docs.dev.resonite-communities.com)
- [x] Update the documentation to explain more the architecture part as well as the usage guide
  - [x] Update the url documentation to `docs.dev.resonite-communities.com` in the README
  - [x] Document about the version system a bit more
- [ ] Doc: Make a rough version of the usage section (as it's useful enough and note just copied notes)
  - [ ] Community configration
  - [ ] Facet client
  - [ ] Web Client
- [ ] Doc: move the information about the date format into a new V2 section
- [ ] Doc: look into setting up the swagger and update the documentation
- [ ] Doc: Work on the architecture section for the developer guide
- [ ] Doc: The usage section of the developer guide seems a bit confusing
