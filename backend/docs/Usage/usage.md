# Usage

The first step to add your community events is to contact brodokk.

After that you will need to refer to the [Community Configuration](community-configuration.md) to setup your community to work with our system.

The last step is to informe your community members that the events are now available with all the following clients.

## Official

- [Facet Client](facet-client.md) to be installed in Resonite on the Dash.
- [Web Client](web-client.md) to be used directly from any web browser.

## Thrid-party

- [Event Slinger](event-slinger.md) to be used when either on your Android phone (including a tablet mode) or Windows device.
