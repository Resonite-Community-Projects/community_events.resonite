# Usage

The first step to add your community events is to contact brodokk.

After that you will need to refer to the [Community Configuration](community-configuration.md) to setup your community to work with our system.

The last step is to informe your community members that the events are now available with all the following clients:

- [Facet Client](facet-client.md) to be installed in Resonite on the Dash.
- [Web Client](web-client.md) to be used when outside of resonite to see all events.
