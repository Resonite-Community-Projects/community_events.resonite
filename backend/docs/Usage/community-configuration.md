# Community Configuration

!!! construction "This need to be documented"

!!! info

    All configuration related directly for a community.

    For example about the Discord bot. This page will stay here in the future and serve as a base of everything a community need to configure. But the url "docs.resonite-communities.com/community-configuration" should be dedicated to this user.


!!! todo

    Explain here everything for a community what they need to do to have their community configured as wanted.

    This should include any question they have on any tool they have managed by the group Resonite Community Projects.

    Why? I am tired to repeat myself


# Event creator usage notes

Since the source can also contains event who can happen in different location, either virtually or physically, the keyword
`Resonite` must be specified either in the `title`, the `description`, or the `location` of an event. New lines and some special
chars before being lowered.
