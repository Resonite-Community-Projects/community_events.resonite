"""
Unit tests for Discord event tagging logic.

Tests the secure-by-default approach for determining whether events
should be tagged as 'public' or 'private' based on community configuration
and event channel placement.

These tests directly test the determine_event_visibility method by
instantiating the class with minimal mocking.
