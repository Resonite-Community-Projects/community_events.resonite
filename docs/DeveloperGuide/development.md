# Development

!!! note

    The current developer guide is only for the community_events.resonite project for the time being.


To help in the development you can checkout our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects) and the following projects:

- [community_events.resonite](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite): Main project and core of the system.
- [resonite-events-frontend](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/resonite-events-frontend): A rewrite of the current frontend in an completly external client using differents Javascript framwork instead of relying on a simple python technology.
- [adult-session-browser](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/adult-session-browser): A system to be able to view sessions for private events in a facet in Resonite directly since Resonite doesn't support this feature yet.
- [accesslistmanager](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/accesslistmanager): A Discord bot for managing Resonite session access via Resonite cloud variable.
