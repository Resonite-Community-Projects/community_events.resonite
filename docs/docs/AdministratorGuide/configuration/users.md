The roles for each users is configurable from the Web Interface`/admin/users`.

**After** a new user try to connect through discord, going at `/auth/login/discord` will become visible on the web page.

This being basic their is only two field available per user: `administrator` and `moderator`.

The `administrator` role will grant user access to everything as well as viewing events of private communities they are not part of.

The `moderator` role will grant user access to only the admin section `/admin/communities` and `/admin/events`.
