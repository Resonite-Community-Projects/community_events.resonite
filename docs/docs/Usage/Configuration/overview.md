# Configurations Overview

For now we support only 2 source where we pull events from:

- [Discord event system](discord.md)
- [Hosted JSON file](hosted-JSON.md)

## Event definition

Since the source can also contains event who can happen in different location, either virtually or physically, the keyword
`Resonite` must be specified either in the `title`, the `description`, or the `location` of an event. New lines and some special
chars before being lowered.
