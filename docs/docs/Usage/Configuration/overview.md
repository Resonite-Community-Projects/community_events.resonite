    For **any** kind of private event please contact directly brodokk!

    In any case any community wanting to be added need to be manually process by brodokk in the respect of the Resonite Guideline.

## Event definition

Since the source can also contains event who can happen in different location, either virtually or physically, the keyword
`Resonite` must be specified either in the `title`, the `description`, or the `location` of an event. New lines and some special
chars before being lowered.
