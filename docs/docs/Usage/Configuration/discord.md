[:fontawesome-brands-discord: Add the discord bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=968246885628391534){ .md-button }

**2. Contact us to enable your community**

For now we are not notified that a community is trying to join the system nor automatic configuration.

So you need to send us a message (mainly to brodokk) and then we will review your community (mainly checking you respect the Resonite Guidelines)
and if everything is good we will update our configuration and you can then see your event appear on our system.

Remember that to have your event shown you need to respect the validation format as stated in the [general configuration overview, section `Event definition`](overview.md#Event definition).
