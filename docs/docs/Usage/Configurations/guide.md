## Event Submission Guidelines

### Event Tagging Requirement

Since a source can contain events that take place in various locations — both virtually and physically — the keyword `Resonite` must be included in either the event’s `title`, `description`, or `location`. This ensures your event is properly categorized and visible in the Resonite event calendar.


### Formatting Requirement:

Before submitting your event, make sure to remove any new lines and certain special characters (`` ` ``) from your submission. This helps prevent formatting issues and ensures our event calendar functions smoothly when displaying your events.
