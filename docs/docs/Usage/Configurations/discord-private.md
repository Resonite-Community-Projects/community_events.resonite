# Discord for Private Communities and Events

!!! warning

    Please do not share this page for now with anyone without authorization from [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com).

For some communities, there's a need for private events or to keep their community private for various reasons. However, only a limited number of communities will be accepted under this system, and only for very good reasons.

Examples of valid reasons for a private community include: corporate events, private workshops, or communities that need to enforce a strict age verification process. Examples of communities that typically cannot use this system include: groups of friends who want to host a private movie night.

### **1. Add the bot to your discord server**

Simply click on the following button to add the bot to your discord, there is no configuration to set on your discord server.

[:fontawesome-brands-discord: Add the discord bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=968246885628391534){ .md-button }

### **2. Configure your events**

!!! Danger

    This section is very important and if not respected correctly will result in a ban from the system of the user configuring it as well as the community.

!!! warning

    Remember that you still need to use the `resonite` keyword in either the `title` or `desription`!

!!! note

    It doesn't matter if your community is private or it mixing public and private events. You must do the following configuration.


Because of how Discord work, you must setup a voice channel and configure all private events **location** to this voice channel.

After this you need to have this voice channel previously created only accessible to a certain role.

On your discord server only the user with the said role will have access to this audio channel and see the said event.

For our system you will need to give us the voice channel id as well as the role id.



### **3. Submit your community for review**

At this time, we do not receive automatic notifications when a community attempts to join the system or requests automatic configuration. To ensure a smooth process and allow us to track all requests efficiently, please submit your community for review using one of the following methods:


*   **Direct Email**: If the above options are not suitable, you may send a message to [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com).

We will then verify that your community complies with the [Resonite Guidelines](https://resonite.com/policies/Guidelines.html) and review your reason for requesting a private community. If everything is in order, we will update our configuration accordingly, and your events will appear in our system. We typically review new community submissions once a week, so you can expect to hear back from us within 7-10 business days.

### **4. Let your community know**

In the case of private events, you will need to use a client that supports private event viewing. Currently, private events can only be viewed using the [Private Web Client](link to Private Web Client here). You will need to log in with your Discord account to see the events you have access to.

If you have questions about accessing private events or need further assistance, please contact [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com).

This guide for private communities is very thorough and provides clear instructions. The warnings and notes are well-placed and effective. Here are a few suggestions to make it even better:

1.  **Clarify the "Why"**: The document states that private communities are only for "very good reason." It would be helpful to provide a few examples of what constitutes a good reason. This would help manage expectations and reduce the number of unqualified requests.
    *   "Examples of valid reasons for a private community include: corporate events, private workshops, or communities that need to enforce a strict age verification process."

2.  **Streamline the Contact Process**: The process currently relies on emailing a single person. To make this more scalable and transparent, you could consider using a different method.
    *   **GitHub Issue Template**: Create a GitHub issue template for private community requests. This would allow you to track all requests in one place and would provide a clear set of questions for the applicant to answer.
    *   **Google Form**: A Google Form could also be used to collect applications in a structured way.

3.  **Visual Aids**: A few screenshots showing how to get the voice channel ID and role ID from Discord would be very helpful. Many users may not be familiar with how to do this.
    *   "To get a role ID, right-click the role in your server settings and select 'Copy Role ID'. You may need to enable Developer Mode in your Discord settings first."

4.  **Client Information**: The last step mentions that a different client is needed for private events. It would be helpful to provide more information about this client directly in the documentation, rather than requiring users to ask for it.
    *   "Private events can only be viewed using the [Private Web Client](link to client). You will need to log in with your Discord account to see the events you have access to."

By implementing these suggestions, you can create a more robust and user-friendly process for managing private communities.
