# Discord for Private Communities and Events

!!! warning

    Please do not share this page for now with anyone without authorization from [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com).

For some communities it can happen they need to have private events for various reasons. Or they simply want to keep their community private.

But keep in mind few communities will be accepted under this system and only for very good reason. Example of community that can't use this system: Group of friends who want to do a movie night.

### **1. Add the bot to your discord server**

Simply click on the following button to add the bot to your discord, there is no configuration to set on your discord server.

[:fontawesome-brands-discord: Add the discord bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=968246885628391534){ .md-button }

### **2. Configure your events**

!!! Danger

    This section is very important and if not respected correctly will result in a ban from the system of the user configuring it as well as the community.

!!! warning

    Remember that you still need to use the `resonite` keyword in either the `title` or `desription`!

!!! note

    It doesn't matter if your community is private or it mixing public and private events. You must do the following configuration.


Because of how Discord work, you must setup a voice channel and configure all private events **location** to this voice channel.

After this you need to have this voice channel previously created only accessible to a certain role.

On your discord server only the user with the said role will have access to this audio channel and see the said event.

For our system you will need to give us the voice channel id as well as the role id.



### **3. Contact us to enable your community**

At this time, we do not receive automatic notifications when a community attempts to join the system or requests automatic configuration.

To proceed, please send a message to [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com) â€” to submit your community for review. We will then verify that your community complies with the [Resonite Guidelines](https://resonite.com/policies/Guidelines.html) as well as the reason **why** you want a private community. If everything is in order, we will update our configuration accordingly, and your event will appear in our system.

### **4. Let your community know**

In the case of private events you will need to use a different client. Please contact [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com) directly if during the previous step you didn't
have this information or you have questions.
