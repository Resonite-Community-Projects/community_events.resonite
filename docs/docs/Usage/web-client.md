## Usage Guide

To use the web client, simply visit the [website](https://resonite-communities.com).

## Legacy vs. New Client

Currently, the primary web client is a simple, server-rendered application. It is stable and functional, but it is considered a **Legacy Web Client** and will eventually be replaced.

We are thinking about developing a **New Web Client** that will be more feature-rich and built using a modern JavaScript framework. You can follow its progress and contribute on its dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/resonite-events-frontend).
