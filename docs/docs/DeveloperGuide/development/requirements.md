While everything should be able to run out-of-the-box with devcontainer (See [the installation section](installation.md)) here is basic requirements for the project to be able to run.

Here is some details for being able to run the project correctly locally and do some development:

- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** Main language used, version fixed at `3.12.*`.
- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** For dependency management.
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** For storing events and configuration, version 16. (See [the server installation section](server-installation.md)).
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** Last version but also Docker Compose (Which is optional).
- **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** Or anything who can handle devcontainer (Recommended).
