# Support

We offer support through both [GitHub](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite) and [Discord](#) to accommodate different preferences, but we encourage using GitHub whenever possible. This keeps information public, organized, and accessible to everyone without limitations like Discord server limit.

**Preferred Support: GitHub**

For technical support, bug reports, feature requests, or general questions:

Open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite/issues) for any bugs or feature suggestions.

If you're unsure where to start or have general setup questions, use the [GitHub Discussions section](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite/discussions) — it’s beginner-friendly and a great place for open conversations.

We highly recommend this option since it allows anyone to join the discussion without needing to join the Discord server.


**Alternative Support: Discord**

If you prefer Discord for more casual, real-time help:

- Use the invite link: [https://discord.gg/VvM5q9Wj](https://discord.gg/VvM5q9Wj)

- Or, contact [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com) directly to request access to the Discord server.

!!! note

    Please avoid reaching out to other team members you might know. [brodokk](mailto:brodokk@resonite-communities.com) is your main point of contact and is happy to assist you directly. In case the email doesn't work, check brodokk [website](https://brodokk.space)
