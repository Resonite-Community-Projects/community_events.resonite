# Support

While the technical support is done over our [GitHub](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite) you can still join us over Discord also to ask question how to setup things.

We try our best to accomate most user so we use both GitHub and Discord.

Please have a preference for GitHub as the information remain public and their is no limit to "join" any discussion (as Discord Server limit).

Open a new [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite/issues) for any bugs or features you would like. Otherwise see the [GitHub Discussions section](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite/discussions). (If you don't know use the [GitHub Discussions section](https://github.com/Resonite-Community-Projects/community_events.resonite/discussions))


If you prefer the discord follow the invite link `No server link for now, contact @brodokk to get access to the server`.

You can also directly contact `@brodokk`. (Avoid to contact other member you way know that are part of the time and prefer to bother me instead)
